        Hey there,
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My name is Kevin, and I am a well versed professional with a background
        in Payroll, HRIS Software, and software engineering. I graduated from
        the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in
        Economics in 2017 and worked as a Payroll Analyst in the software
        industry until 2022.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        From the moment I started my professional career, I knew that I wanted
        to explore the world of programming. I got my start by writing VBA and
        Python scripts to automate tasks in my previous jobs.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        These days, I task myself with the role of using my skills to build
        software that not only solves problems, but satiates my thirst for
        knowledge. I love learning new tech, strengthening my current foundation
        of knowledge, and getting good at whatever I set my mind to.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I'm currently looking for a new Software engineering role, so if
        you&apos;d like to see the projects I&apos;ve worked on please find my
        github{' '}
